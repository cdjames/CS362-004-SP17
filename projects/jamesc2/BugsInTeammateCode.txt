Bug report (formal):
[Title]: Empty deck is not shuffled [Sea Hag]
[ID]: 0001
[Priority]: A
[Pre-conditions]: build cardtest3 binary
[Steps]: 
1. run cardtest3 binary
2. look at results of test "P2 deck now size of discard"
[Expected]: Player 2 deck size should be size of previous discard pile
[Observed]: Player 2 deck size is -3
[Specification]: http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Sea_Hag
"A player with no cards left in his deck shuffles first in order to get a card to discard."
[Cause]: There is no check for deck size in the sea_hag case (lines 1359-1370)

[Title]: Curse is not top card after Sea Hag
[ID]: 0002
[Priority]: A
[Pre-conditions]: build cardtest3 binary
[Steps]: 
1. run cardtest3 binary
2. look at results of test "Curse top in p. 2 deck" in iteration 1.
[Expected]: Top card in player 2's hand should be curse
[Observed]: Top card in player 2's hand is not curse
[Specification]: http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Sea_Hag
"...puts Curse cards right on top of an opponent's deck"
[Cause]: In-place decrement is used errantly on lines 1364, 1365, and 1367 (should be no decrements)
